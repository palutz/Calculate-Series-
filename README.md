# Calculate Series

1. Calculate a single series of numbers given the following requirements:

  a. The first number is calculated given the following function (which accepts a parameter ‘x’):
    ((0.5 * x^2) + (30 * x) + 10) / 25
    
  b. A growth rate for the series is calculated using the following function (which accepts parameters ‘y’ and the first number from a.):
    (2% of y)/25/(firstNumber)
    
  c. The overall series is calculated using a function that accepts three parameters firstNumber – the number from a.
    growthRate – the number from b.
    length ­ the length of the resulting series
    The series should start with the first number; the subsequent numbers should be calculated as a product of:
      growthRate * (firstNumber^(index of the number being generated))
      
  d. The series should not contain any duplicates, be ordered from the lowest to the highest e. The numbers in the series should be rounded to the nearest 0.25 (so 10.63 should be rounded to 10.75, 12.12 should be rounded to 12.00)




2. Select two ‘special’ numbers from the series:

  a. N umber1 is the third largest number in the ordered series
  
  b. N umber2 is chosen by first calculating the product of the following function approximateNumber = y/z, where ‘y’ is a constant and ‘z’ is an input of the function, then by selecting the closest number in the series to the aproximateNumber. If two numbers are evenly apart from the approxim teNumber the highest number is chosen.
  
  
  
Please provide unit tests to verify that your application is calculating correct results.
Please make sure your solution runs, if there are any special instructions to build, or run the solution please also let us know.

Part 1)

a. when x = 1, firstNumber = 1.62

b. when y = 5062.5, growthRate = 2.5 c, d when length = 5 the series is:

1.62

4.05

6.561 10.62882 17.2186884



e. rounded:

1.5

4

6.5 10.75 17.25



Part 2)

a. 6.5 is special

b. for y = 1000 and z = 160

approximateNumber = 6.25, which makes 6.5 special.
